# MINT-ELONMUSK-NFT

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case.
In this project we will implement a smart contract and mint ElonMuskNFT on the opensea testnet.
Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/run.ts
```

Once your contract is deployed. You can do the following things.
- Copy your contract address and scan it on Goerli Ethercan. The contract address must have appeared on terminal because of console log.
- Copy the public address of your Metamask wallet and check it on testnets.opensea.io.
